<h1>Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name's Jules</h1>


<h2>Iâ€™m currently working and training as a Junior Software Engineer with the School of Code.</h2>

Over the last few years I've worked in <strong>Project Management</strong> for clients such as Jaguar Land Rover and Gymshark, but I've worn many hats since finishing a Performing Arts Degree â€“ concentrating on Screenwriting and Production â€“ all the way back in 2007. 

I've been a Fitness Instructor, a Princess at Warwick Castle (not as fun as it sounds) a HR Adminsitrator, Camera Operator, Video Editor, Producer and a Web Officer. 

I still write film and tv scripts and dabble in a bit of short film production, but will be balancing that out with problem solving and writing code!
